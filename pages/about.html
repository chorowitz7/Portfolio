<h1>About Me</h1>

<div class="informationCard" id="ic1">

<div class="informationCard" id="ic2">
    <p>My journey started off as a student at the University of Maine in 2016 as a Finance student. After completing a FinTech course during my Spring 2017 semester, I realized that going into the technology field is what I wanted to pursue. Building coupled with technology is the perfect combination to fuel my passion for the web development and software development field.</p>
    <p>After my freshman year at the University of Maine, I transferred to Quinnipiac University to pursue my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Information Systems. This change of school and major gave me a great opportunity to do what I am passionate about.</p>
    <p>Technology is the now and the future, and I want to be a part of the journey.</p>
